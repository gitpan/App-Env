	* lib/App/Env.pm, lib/App/Env/Example.pm, t/App/Env/Site1/App1.pm:
	The AppOpts hash is now passed as the sole parameter to the envs
	function.

	Clean up mess from previous work where the app env module's envs()
	function took a more complicated input parameter. Now just gets the
	AppOpts hash directly.

	* MANIFEST:
	remove META.yml; seems to mess up make dist

	* Makefile.PL, lib/App/Env.pm:
	don't use Module::Load::Conditional. clean up envs invocation.

	Originally Module::Load::Conditional was used to determine whether a
	module existed separately from whether there was an error during its
	compilation (Module::Load doesn't distinguish this case). However
	Module::Load::Conditional's dependency chain is larger than I'd
	like.

	Instead, Module::Load was emulated using eval "require $module".
	Same results, perhaps less efficient because it requires a run time
	compilation.

	 calling the envs function in the application environment module is
	no longer done with eval (once I figured out how to get the symbolic
	reference to work).
