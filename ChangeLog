	* lib/App/Env.pm, lib/App/Env/Example.pm, t/cache.t:
	fix multi-app environments

	multi-app environments had a number of fundamental problems.

	* the method for merging individual application's environments was
	extremely simplistic and could result in parts of an app's
	environment being reset.

	* application environments were not necessarily based on the current
	environment and when applied could reset the user's environment.
	This problem was found for environments created by shell scripts
	where the user's profile or .cshrc was sourced as part of the shell
	invocation, in many cases resulting in a reset of the environment to
	its inital state at login.

	To avoid these problems, a new restriction was placed upon the
	application specific modules. They must create their environments
	based upon the current one, merging their changes into it. When
	creating a merged environment, the application modules are
	successively invoked on a copy of the current environment and the
	final environment is used. Previously the modules' environments
	were "merged" in a rather inflexible manner, resulting in
	overwriting changes. This also means that 1) cached application
	environments can't be used during a merger and 2) application
	environments can't be cached during the course of a merger.

	* lib/App/Env.pm, lib/App/Env/Example.pm, t/App/Env/Site1/App1.pm:
	The AppOpts hash is now passed as the sole parameter to the envs
	function.

	Clean up mess from previous work where the app env module's envs()
	function took a more complicated input parameter. Now just gets the
	AppOpts hash directly.

	* Makefile.PL, lib/App/Env.pm:
	don't use Module::Load::Conditional. clean up envs invocation.

	Originally Module::Load::Conditional was used to determine whether a
	module existed separately from whether there was an error during its
	compilation (Module::Load doesn't distinguish this case). However
	Module::Load::Conditional's dependency chain is larger than I'd
	like.

	Instead, Module::Load was emulated using eval "require $module".
	Same results, perhaps less efficient because it requires a run time
	compilation.

	 calling the envs function in the application environment module is
	no longer done with eval (once I figured out how to get the symbolic
	reference to work).
