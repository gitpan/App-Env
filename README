App-Env
=======

This module is useful when a Perl program must run external
applications in environments specific to them. Often an application or
application suite requires a specific environmental variable setup to
operate correctly.

App::Env provides a uniform mechanism for accessing environments and
is most useful in situations where multiple applications with
differing environments are to be invoked, although it is still useful
in simpler contexts.

App::Env may be used to simply merge (import) the application's
environment directly into the current environment.  It can also
provide the environment as an object to provide more fine grained
operations.

To avoid redoing expensive setup operations environments are cached.

The packaged appexec program provides this functionality for one-off command
line invocations of programs.
