Revision history for Perl extension App::Env.

0.22  Thu Jun  3 12:44:43 EDT 2010
        - if CacheID is the string 'AppID', the cache id does not
	  take into account the contents of the AppOpts hash.
	- new feature from v. 0.20 (cached environments keyed off of
          AppOpts hash) now actually works.

0.21  Wed Jun  2 10:28:42 EDT 2010
        - no longer uses Object::ID to work around problems with
	  Hash::FieldHash and older perls.

0.20  Fri May 28 12:11:51 EDT 2010
        - cached environments now keyed off of AppOpts hash
        - (hopefully) improve Windows compatibility

0.15  Mon Oct 27 14:10:29 EDT 2008
        - invert logic of shell magic characters; escape those not known to
	  good.

0.14  Fri Jul 11 21:17:02 EDT 2008
        - escape more shell magic characters

0.13  Fri Jul 11 15:59:30 EDT 2008
        - append semi-colons to appenv's dumpenv output so that shell
          eval's will actually work

0.12  Fri Jul 11 13:31:09 EDT 2008
        - appenv's dumpenv has more output formats. its value is now required.
	  previously it was optional, which led to its grabbing
	  the environment name if --env wasn't used. bad form.

0.11  Mon Jun 16 12:27:20 EDT 2008
        - new setenv() method allows changing an environment.

0.10  Sun Jun 15 23:26:29 EDT 2008
        - new SysFatal option which will cause system/qexec/capture
	  object methods to throw an exception on error.  Uses
	  IPC::System::Simple in this case.
	- Default option values may now be changed.

0.09  Sat Mar 22 22:44:32 EDT 2008
        - lowercase aliasing failed if Site was not set.

0.08  Sat Mar 22 22:03:47 EDT 2008
        - application module search is no longer sensitive to the case
          of the application name

0.07  Sat Mar 22 13:19:29 EDT 2008
        - application environments may now have aliases, which
	  can preset options
	- site search was not done exactly according to specs
	- improved method for searching for environment modules to
	  distinguish between non-existant modules and compilation errors
	- env() (and now str() as well) can specify variables to
	  include in a more flexible fashion.  the returned value is
	  more flexible (more context dependent) and excruciatingly
	  documented.
	- more restrictive str() generation of TERMCAP to make
	  it easier to exclude variables without needing to specify TERMCAP
 

0.06  Sun Feb  3 14:11:39 EST 2008
        - fix for multi-app environments
	- application environments must now be based upon the current
	  environment
	- cached application environments are not used in multi-app
	  environments, nor will individual environments be cached in
	  the course of creating a multi-app environment

0.05  Thu Jan 17 15:15:38 EST 2008
