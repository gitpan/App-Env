Revision history for Perl extension App::Env.

0.11  Mon Jun 16 12:27:20 EDT 2008
        - new setenv() method allows changing an environment.

0.10  Sun Jun 15 23:26:29 EDT 2008
        - new SysFatal option which will cause system/qexec/capture
	  object methods to throw an exception on error.  Uses
	  IPC::System::Simple in this case.
	- Default option values may now be changed.

0.09  Sat Mar 22 22:44:32 EDT 2008
        - lowercase aliasing failed if Site was not set.

0.08  Sat Mar 22 22:03:47 EDT 2008
        - application module search is no longer sensitive to the case
          of the application name

0.07  Sat Mar 22 13:19:29 EDT 2008
        - application environments may now have aliases, which
	  can preset options
	- site search was not done exactly according to specs
	- improved method for searching for environment modules to
	  distinguish between non-existant modules and compilation errors
	- env() (and now str() as well) can specify variables to
	  include in a more flexible fashion.  the returned value is
	  more flexible (more context dependent) and excruciatingly
	  documented.
	- more restrictive str() generation of TERMCAP to make
	  it easier to exclude variables without needing to specify TERMCAP

        - fix for multi-app environments
	- application environments must now be based upon the current
